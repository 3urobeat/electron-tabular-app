# electron-tabular-app
A small tabular management app writting in JS with electron.
This app is intentionally very basic and was made for my mom to quickly and easily take track of work related things.

ðŸš§ This project is not finished yet.

## Features (when finished)
* Add your own language by translating language file
* Add new tabulars with custom amount of columns
* Choose between tabulars in main window
* Add new rows - also between other rows
* Edit rows
* Search in columns
* Export tabular to Excel

## Download & Start

[Download app](https://github.com/HerrEurobeat/electron-tabular-app/archive/master.zip)
[Download node](https://nodejs.org)

```
//Install packages:
npm install

//When finished -> start app
npm start
```

## Note
Since this app was made for personal use it probably won't get feature request added.
I also don't plan on working with issues in this project as I don't want to spend too much time on it.
This is my first project working with electron and making an desktop gui app in general.
